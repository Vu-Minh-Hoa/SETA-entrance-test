### `Problem 1: Most common Strings by length in an Array`

Input: The function takes an array of strings as its argument.
Output: It returns an array containing the strings with lengths most frequently appeared in the input array.

I have covered these edge case:

- There must be an Array;
- Array need to have value
- There must only be string in it

For the algorithm logic:

- First I Iterate through the Array to count the length and how many time it appear for each length in the Array
- Next I get the number of time it appear to get the max number of time the string length appear then I use that to only get the string length to filter out the most appear strings
- If there is two or more difference string length but appearance is equal to each other then it will console out all the strings that have the same strings length with those

### `Problem 2`

Input: The function takes an array of numbers as its argument.
Output: It returns the sum of the two largest numbers in the input array.

I have covered these edge case:

- There must be an Array;
- Array need to have value
- There must only be number in it

For the algorithm logic:

- I only need to sort the array and get the first two number to get the result
